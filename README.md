@Zchryrr
================================

Zchryrr (interchangeable with @Zchryrr) is a Twitter bot made up in Python to do simple tasks. Currently, the tasks include:

* /#TOR [link.torrent] - Begin torrents from a URL via a reply (only from users in the sudoers_list). You knowâ€¦ for your favorite Linux distros

* \#STATCHE [image.jpg] - Serve up mustached images!

* \#STATUS - Return the status of @Zchryrr (If he's running - if he's not running he won't return anything)

* \#PING - Send a Prowl ping to my phone (used for debugging purposes)

* \#SHUTDOWN - Shutdown Zchryrr (only useable by people in suoders_list)

* \#FOLLOW [username] - Follow users by request (needs authorization). The username should not have an @ in it

* Testa Mode - Responds to all questions mentioning Zchryrr with a "Nope! Chuck Testa!" Can be toggled with \#TESTA

How Can I Use Zchryrr?
--------------------------------

To actually use Zchryrr, you'll need to have your own Twitter account (unless you want to run this on your primary account, which I do not recommend). I'll trust you can figure out how to make a Twitter account.

Next, head over to [dev.twitter.com](http://www.dev.twitter.com/) and sign in to your new Twitter account. Under the drop down of your name, click "My applications"

![Drop Down Menu](http://zachorr.com/zchryrrpics/0.png)

Assuming you don't have any other applications yet, click the "Create a new application" button

![Who can blame me? Vowels ARE pretty lame](http://zachorr.com/zchryrrpics/1.png)

I'm gonna leave you with the picture below for how to set up the application. It's pretty simple.

![Easy enough?](http://zachorr.com/zchryrrpics/2.png)

Don't forget to agree to the ToS and enter the CAPTCHAs at the bottom. 

On the page you get directed to, you'll need to click the "Create my access token" button to get the information you need. The rest of the information you might need is included on that page.

![I know what you're thinking, you sneaky snake. But that application is no longer valid.](http://zachorr.com/zchryrrpics/3.png)

Then go to the "Settings" tab and change your "Application Type" to "Read, Write, and Access direct messages"

![Don't worry. Zchryrr won't go all HAL 9000 on you. You can trust him to access your DMs](http://zachorr.com/zchryrrpics/4.png)

Now that we have that all set up, let's start with the actual code. To run your own Zchryrr on your local server, you'll need to first install Tweepy (the Python Twitter library I use)

	sudo pip install tweepy
	
Next, you'll need to edit your vars.py file to make sure that you have all of your information for you Python bot. You'll need to make a new application through the Twitter developer API (details and images on how to do this will come later). In vars.py, fill in the following areas

	p = pyrowl.Pyrowl("api key", "providerkey") #Check the Prowl website for an API key
	
	CONSUMER_KEY = '' #Set your Twitter consumer key
	
	CONSUMER_SECRET = '' #Set your Twitter consumer secret
	
	ACCESS_KEY='' #Set your Twitter access key
	
	ACCESS_SECRET='' #Set your Twitter access secret
	
	sudoers = ["ZacharyOrr"] #List of users who will have access to upper level commands, like starting torrents or shutting the bot down
	
	invalid_sudoer_message = "" #Message that will be tweeted when someone not in the list above tries to use an upper level command
	
	torrent_directory = "/home/zachorr/torrents/" #Directory that your torrent files will be downloaded to. Usually dependent on if you have torrents automatically starting from a folder location
	
After filling in all of that information, you should be set to go. CD to your directory and run
	
	python zchryrr.py

And if you'd like him to run in the background, run

	python zchryrr.py

Taking Advantage of Zchryrr
--------------------------------

Using Zchryrr is relatively simple. As you might excpect, you send a reply to @Zchryrr with a vaild hashtag (you can find the complete list of commands in the Python script or above)

![Because staches make everything cooler](http://zachorr.com/zchryrrpics/5.png)

And as you might expect, he replies to you at ridicioulsy fast speeds

![Look at him go! He's a tweeting fool!](http://zachorr.com/zchryrrpics/6.png)


And my implementation of this script, the real Zchryrr, is always running over at [twitter.com/Zchryrr](http://www.twitter.com/Zchryrr). Feel free to use him all you'd like! If you break him, I should be notified.

Upcoming Features List
--------------------------------

* \#CuteCatMeBro - Serves up random cute cat images from Tumblr. Because who couldn't use more cute cats?

* Select memes will be able to be generated on the fly. To start, it'll just be some of my favorites.
