@Zchryrr
================================

Zchryrr (interchangeable with @Zchryrr) is a Twitter bot made up in Python to do simple tasks. Currently, the tasks include:

* Shutdown Zchryrr (only useable by myself - any additions to usernames will be changed)

* Send a Prowl ping to my phone (used for debugging purposes)

* Begin torrents from a URL via a reply (only from users in the authorized_torrenters list)

* Return the status of @Zchryrr (If he's running - if he's not running he won't return anything)

* Follow users by request (needs authorization)

* Serve up mustached images!

How Can I Use @Zchryrr????
--------------------------------

Thanks for having an interest in using/contribuiting to Zchryrr. There are two ways that you can
contribuite to the bot.

First, you can download the bot and run him locally on your own server. If you'd like to use all the
bells and whistles currently written into Zchryrr, you can do so by filling in your OAuth for your 
own Twitter account (instructions on how to do so to come later), fill in a Prowl API key, and put
in a local directory to download torrents in. After that, you'll have a working version of Zchryrr
running on your own Twitter account (I do not recommend doing it to your main account).

Second, if you'd like to contribuite to the code, fork the repo, make some changes, and submit 
a pull request. Once I review the code, unit tests will be run, and if everything succeeds, Zchryrr 
will be running your new code! Feel free to use the command you just added as much as you'd like.
